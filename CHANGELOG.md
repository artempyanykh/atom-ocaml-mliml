## 0.3.0
* Don't open matching code/interface file if it does not exist. Previously,
  an empty buffer was created which is not necessarily desirable. I might
  make it a configuration option in future.

## 0.2.0
* Figured out publishing

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed
